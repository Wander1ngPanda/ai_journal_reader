Malaria is an acute febrile infectious disease caused by the protozoan Plasmodium, transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, with 249 million cases and 608,000 deaths estimated in 2022. In Brazil, malaria is mainly found in the Legal Amazon states, with 139,107 cases and 61 deaths recorded in 2021. Illegal mining activities contribute to the spread of malaria, particularly in areas like Boa Vista, Roraima. Symptoms include fever, headache, and chills, with P. vivax being the most common parasite. Effective public policies and surveillance are needed to control the disease and achieve the goal of eliminating malaria transmission in Brazil by 2035.
