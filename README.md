# ai_journal_reader
This is a Python app that is able to read through scientific journals and be able to answer questions regarding the content and findings
The code should be annotated to explain each step and help furtehr my understanding on what each aspect is doing

It should also be able to run offline using llama but might also add chatgpt and open ai ability

Note: I wonder if Llava is able to analyse graphs
